# Dynamic Array Implementation in Python

This project implements a `Dynamic Array` class in Python as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey. It mimics the functionality of Python's built-in `list` with additional flexibility for future expansion.

## Features

- Dynamic resizing
- Basic list operations: append, remove, pop, find, insert, clear
- Custom indexing and deletion
- C-style array management using `ctypes`

## TODO

- Implement additional functionalities:
  - Sorting
  - Min/Max/Sum
  - Extend
  - Slicing
  - Merging with other arrays

## Usage

```python
from dynamic_array import MyList

L = MyList()
L.append(1)
L.append(2)
print(L)  # Output: [1, 2]
```
